# CustomQuests - Create new quests for ATLYSS!

* Create new quests using easily-editable JSON files!

* Add quests to NPCs that previously never had quests!

* A variety of options allowing you to customize quests to your liking!

* You can even reference custom items and creeps added by other mods!

* 3 new quests included as a demonstration.

To make your own custom quests, create a plugin with a CustomQuests-Files folder. You can use the quests included with this mod as a template to learn how things work. I want to eventually make a guide, but for now you can look [here](https://github.com/Yavamar/CustomQuests/blob/master/ParsedQuest.cs) to see which fields are available to use in the JSON files.
